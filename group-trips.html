      <p><em>Serious question... Is there anything better than making new
      like-minded friends from around the world, as you explore the most
      incredible places!? We started hosting group trips because we love our
      beautiful community and we love to make new friends that share our travel
      interests!</em></p><p><em>Whether you want to travel but your friends
      can't, or if the thought of planning is overwhelming, or if you love solo
      travel but you also love group trips, thats why we've created these! They
      are all-inclusive, and everything is taken care of. Just show up and be
      ready to make life-long memories and friendships! Click through the trips
      above to see which one is for you :)</em></p><blockquote><h4><em>“There is
      an unspoken bond you create with the friends you travel with.” – Kristen
