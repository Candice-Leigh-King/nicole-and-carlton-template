         social media marketing, sponsored stories and posts, brand ambassadorship, blogging and reviews. think of this as a way to broadcast your brand's message, product and/or service. You want to work with influencers who have a strong relationship with followers you want to target.

        Now, when it comes to working with us itâ€™s like paying for 1 service but
        getting 2 (since we're mega influencers with expensive toys and known to
        handover high-quality photography and videography).


        looking to reach new audiences


         "I want to book this room", but you're also getting raved about to our 3 million followers.

        Still not quite sure what that means? Ok, let us explain it like this...
        How much will is cost you to put your TV commercial in front of 3
        million travel-hungry people who can afford your hotel rooms? Probably a
        couple $10,000s (maybe even a few $100,000s). Well, we can reach that
        audience for not even a 1/4 of that price.

         For the last 3 years, we've been building the most supportive community of travel-hungry, enthusiastic fans. Although, we LOVE beautifully curated videography and photography, our strongest and most valuable asset is showing off our personality and the brands we love through fun, relatable content that goes viral every time! We want to do this with you too!

        "80% of consumers have purchased something via an influencer
        recommendation." - startupbonsai.com


        we have worked with renowned brands and 50+ amazing other brands.


        Allow us to be blunt. Traditional marketing just doesnâ€™t work. At least
        not when it comes to millennials. Millennial shoppers view the world
        through a digital lens. Whether youâ€™re at a restaurant, concert or bar
        everyone is scrolling on their phones. All the time. 


        The real question is, how do you get them to stop scrolling? Thatâ€™s
        where we come in.


        For your brand to succeed, social media is crucial. After all, the
        majority of our spending decisions are influenced by what we see online.
        But millennials donâ€™t want cookie cutter perfection. And they certainly
        donâ€™t want to feel like theyâ€™re being marketed to. 


        Thatâ€™s why as experienced content creators, we create engagement through
        meaningful content that isnâ€™t an ad. Itâ€™s authentic, like a
        recommendation from a friend.

          <p>It was a great pleasure working with Nicole and Colton. We wanted
          to emphasize the romantic and relaxing atmosphere of our establishment
          and they perfectly represented the spirit of our hotel through their
          work and even exceeded our expectations thanks to their high-quality
          content! You can see their great work on our website and
          socials.&nbsp;</p><p>We will surely reconduct this collaboration which
          was a real success! The Wakefield Mill Hotel &amp; Spa highly
          recommends them.</p>

          <p>Your content has allowed us to reach a new audience and has shown
          other couples what it is like to have a shared spa experience at
          Uppliva!</p><p>The videos you created really captured the feeling of
          the spa, showed a lot of creativity and your posts had a lot of
          engagement and reach. I also appreciate that some new angles were
          captured of our space and that the two of you had fun with it!</p>

          <p>It was an absolute pleasure working with Nicole and Colton for
          Nordikâ€™s Valentineâ€™s Day Campaign! From planning their media visit, to
          content creation, and communicating throughout the entire process â€“
          they were very organized and professional. They delivered high
          quality, on brand images and videos that beautifully captured the
          spaâ€™s atmosphere.</p><p>Thank you again for a beautiful collaboration,
          and we wish you the best in your future endeavours.</p>

          may be! It's been a great collaboration with you and my team loves
          your content (if you notice, your content is shared throughout all
          regional RHINOSHIELD IG accounts -- they think the content is really
          good!). I will definitely keep you in mind for the next
          campaign!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Nicole and Colton were beyond professional when taking this
          collaboration with us at Fairmont Le ChÃ¢teau Montebello. They did an
          amazing job in putting forward specific experiences we were looking to
          showcase and understood our needs and content was great as expected.
          We look forward to collaborating with them again in the near

          <p>It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Nicole and Colton for the
          creation of social media content.</p><p>We wanted to work with these
          two because of the qualitative and romantic content they create.
          During the partnership, they were very flexible, friendly and
          professional, and I was already pleasantly surprised by their approach
          before they came to our hotel. They took the time to study the
          services offered by Lenkerhof Gourmet Spa Resort, analyzed the images
          that other people had already produced and proposed other ideas. They
          respected our specifications, delivered high quality pictures in
          different sizes and even produced more content than
          expected.</p><p>&nbsp;Working with Nicole and Colton has been
          extremely enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Nicole and Colton were wonderful to work with and really captured
          the essence of a Cabinscape stay. They were professional and
          communicative via email and socials with our entire team before,
          during and after their stay.</p><p>The deliverables they provided
          exceeded expectations and their media content was of great quality and
          included reels, pictures, drone footage, etc. that we can use across
          our socials, website, newsletters and more. The shared posts and
          stories had great engagement and they were flexible when we ran into
          some tech issues with our Instagram page.</p><p>We would highly
          recommend partnering with them for future projects. Thanks for all
          your hard work :)</p>
