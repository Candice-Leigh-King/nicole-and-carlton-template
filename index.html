         social media marketing, sponsored stories and posts, brand ambassadorship, blogging and reviews. think of this as a way to broadcast your brand's message, product and/or service. You want to work with influencers who have a strong relationship with followers you want to target.

        Now, when it comes to working with us itâ€™s like paying for 1 service but
        getting 2 (since we're mega influencers with expensive toys and known to
        handover high-quality photography and videography).


        looking to reach new audiences


         "I want to book this room", but you're also getting raved about to our 3 million followers.

        Still not quite sure what that means? Ok, let us explain it like this...
        How much will is cost you to put your TV commercial in front of 3
        million travel-hungry people who can afford your hotel rooms? Probably a
        couple $10,000s (maybe even a few $100,000s). Well, we can reach that
        audience for not even a 1/4 of that price.

         For the last 3 years, we've been building the most supportive community of travel-hungry, enthusiastic fans. Although, we LOVE beautifully curated videography and photography, our strongest and most valuable asset is showing off our personality and the brands we love through fun, relatable content that goes viral every time! We want to do this with you too!

        "80% of consumers have purchased something via an influencer
        recommendation." - startupbonsai.com


        we have worked with renowned brands and 50+ amazing other brands.


        Allow us to be blunt. Traditional marketing just doesnâ€™t work. At least
        not when it comes to millennials. Millennial shoppers view the world
        through a digital lens. Whether youâ€™re at a restaurant, concert or bar
        everyone is scrolling on their phones. All the time. 


        The real question is, how do you get them to stop scrolling? Thatâ€™s
        where we come in.


        For your brand to succeed, social media is crucial. After all, the
        majority of our spending decisions are influenced by what we see online.
        But millennials donâ€™t want cookie cutter perfection. And they certainly
        donâ€™t want to feel like theyâ€™re being marketed to. 


        Thatâ€™s why as experienced content creators, we create engagement through
        meaningful content that isnâ€™t an ad. Itâ€™s authentic, like a
        recommendation from a friend.
