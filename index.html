         think of this as a way to broadcast your brand's message, product and/or service. You want to work with influencers who have a strong relationship with followers you want to target.

        Now, when it comes to working with us itâ€™s like paying for 1 service but
        getting 2 (since we're mega influencers with expensive toys and known to
        handover high-quality photography and videography).


        looking to reach new audiences


         "I want to book this room", but you're also getting raved about to our 3 million followers.

        Still not quite sure what that means? Ok, let us explain it like this...
        How much will is cost you to put your TV commercial in front of 3
        million travel-hungry people who can afford your hotel rooms? Probably a
        couple $10,000s (maybe even a few $100,000s). Well, we can reach that
        audience for not even a 1/4 of that price.

         For the last 3 years, we've been building the most supportive community of travel-hungry, enthusiastic fans. Although, we LOVE beautifully curated videography and photography, our strongest and most valuable asset is showing off our personality and the brands we love through fun, relatable content that goes viral every time! We want to do this with you too!

        "80% of consumers have purchased something via an influencer
        recommendation." - startupbonsai.com


        we have worked with renowned brands and 50+ amazing other brands.

          hobby into a business which meant I needed to upgrade my website. In
          search of doing so, I found The Kings and decided to have them build
          me a custom-made website because I wanted my website to stick out from
          all the rest of the websites.</p><p>I gave them an idea of what I
          wanted and they created a website more than I could have envisioned
          (and may I add that they did so in so little time). I'm absolutely in
          love with the results.</p><p>Besides being so professional, Jonty and
          Candy are very kind, and patient, and are continuously available to
          answer any question I have even after the website handover.</p>
